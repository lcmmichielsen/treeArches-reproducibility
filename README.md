# treeArches: single-cell reference mapping to construct and extend cell type hierarchies

<img width="750px" align="center" src="/sketch/Sketch.png?raw=true">

This repository contains jupyter notebooks to reproduce the results and figures from treeArches. treeArches is a framework around two existing methods: [scArches](https://github.com/theislab/scarches) and [scHPL](https://github.com/lcmmichielsen/scHPL). 

If you want to reproduce the complete results, you will have to install scArches and scHPL. If you just want to reproduce the figures, you can download the latent spaces we created from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6786357). 

### Installation & documentation

treeArches is automatically installed when installing scArches. Check this [link](https://scarches.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for more information about installing scArches. 

Documentation and tutorials can be found in the [scArches documentation](https://scarches.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and the [scHPL github](https://github.com/lcmmichielsen/scHPL). The [PBMC](Figure1%20(PBMC)/PBMC%20(Figure%201%2C%20S1%2C%20S2).ipynb) reproducibility notebook is also a vignette that guides you through the possible functionalities.
